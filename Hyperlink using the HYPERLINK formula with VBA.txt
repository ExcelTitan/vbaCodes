' ## Hyperlink a file or folder using the HYPERLINK formula in the active cell
'    Syntax: HYPERLINK(link_location, [friendly_name])
'    Link_location: (required) the path and file name to the document to be opened.
'    Friendly_name: (optional) the jump text or numeric value that is displayed in the cell.
'                   Friendly_name is displayed in blue and is underlined. If friendly_name is
'                   omitted, the cell displays the link_location as the jump text.
