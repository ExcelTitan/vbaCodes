Every now and then we need a column that tracks the item count for each transation in our table.

A simple formula in a column referencing the current cell’s row minus the row number of the table header row will give you the correct item number for each line in the table.

If you’re table is named Table1 and the column header is 'ID'

=ROW()-ROW(Table1[[#Headers],[ID]])
