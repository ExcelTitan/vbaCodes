Here are some basic methods to get a Column Letter & Row Number from both parts of a Range ie. "A1:B2". The examples below will result in Column "A", Row "1", Column "B" & Row "2". This can be very useful when building dynamic Ranges:

' // select a Range for the Example
Range("A1:B2").Select
 
' // identify the Column for the first part of the Range following the ":"
MsgBox Split(Split(Selection.Address, ":")(0), "$")(1)
 
' // identify the Row for the first part of the Range following the ":"
MsgBox Split(Split(Selection.Address, ":")(0), "$")(2)
 
' // identify the Column for the second part of the Range following the ":"
MsgBox Split(Split(Selection.Address, ":")(1), "$")(1)
 
' // identify the Row for the second part of the Range following the ":"
MsgBox Split(Split(Selection.Address, ":")(1), "$")(2)
