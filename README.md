# A library of VBA Codes

An ever growing list of VBA snippets of code for programmatic use or for daily tasks.

> Knowledge should be shared freely, not hoarded. I wanted a place to put all the bits and pieces of VBA that I have learned and sourced over the years in one place.
I like to educate others and also to learn how I can do any task better.

## ExcelTitan Add-in
I wanted a way to make it easier to find exactly what I'm looking for on the ExcelTitan Github by either file name or topic
That's why I have created an Excel Add-in that breaks down the codes into topic but also type and search for a file name.

You aren't  restricted to just looking for VBA codes either, this add-in searches my Excel Formulas tutorials and provides links to other useful programs.
