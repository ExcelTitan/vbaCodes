' ## Toggles the Ribbon and hides the formula bar and headings
'	 This toggles Ribbon in Excel to hide or display. The ribbon in it's minimized state is in
'	 most cases less than 80. Testing this height tells us if we can hide the formula bar and 
'	 headings. You can test the height of the ribbon with this snippet:
'	 MsgBox CommandBars("Ribbon").Height
'	 Also hiding the formula bar and headings is optional. Note that the ribbon will be 
'	 minimized and formula bar hidden for all sheets in all workbooks. The headings will only
'	 be hidden for the active sheet.

Sub ToggleRibbon()
	'// Toggle the ribbon
	Application.CommandBars.ExecuteMso "MinimizeRibbon"
	
	'// Optimise and hide the formula bar and headers with the ribbon
	Application.ScreenUpdating = False

	'// If the ribbon height is > 80 then hide the formula bar 
	'	and headings else show them
	If Application.CommandBars.Item("Ribbon").Height > 80 Then
		Application.DisplayFormulaBar = False
		ActiveWindow.DisplayHeadings = False
	Else
		Application.DisplayFormulaBar = True
		ActiveWindow.DisplayHeadings = True
	End If

	'// Optimise
